J2ME Apps Collection
A set of real MIDP-2.0 / CLDC-1.1 apps. Works in J2ME Loader (Android) and on real Java ME devices.

What’s inside:

Cornell-Cube3D — the app contains three scenes: a rotating wireframe cube, three spheres with path tracing, and a Cornell scene with full path tracing for cell phones.
FluidSim2D — Incredible 2D fluid physics simulation
ReactiveLight 2D — 2D visualization of ray emission with beautiful refraction in prisms
Mini_Mine — voxel world with 3D raster and a path tracer (AO, soft shadows, color bleeding, progressive accumulation)
Cloth Physics Simulator — mass-spring cloth, sphere/ground collisions, Z-buffer, simple lighting
System Info (AIDA64-like) — phone/JVM diagnostics, JSR support, memory, display, colors, key map, RMS, mini benchmark
